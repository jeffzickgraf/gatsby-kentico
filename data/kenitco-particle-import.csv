Adafruit INA219 FeatherWing	The Adafruit INA219 FeatherWing makes power-monitoring problems a thing of the past	7.95	ina_large.jpg	"<p><strong>*Now available to order, shipping November 2018. If you add additional items to your order, your entire order will not ship until November 2018.*</strong></p>
<p>The INA219 FeatherWing makes power-monitoring problems a thing of the past. Instead of struggling with two multimeters, you can just use the handy INA219B chip on this breakout to measure both the high side voltage and DC current draw over I2C with 1% precision. Works with all Feather boards including the new Particle Argon, Boron, and Xenon.</p>
<p>This chip is smarter than your average current-measuring devices. It can handle high side current measuring, up to +26VDC, even though it is powered with 3.3V. It will also report back that high side voltage, which is great for tracking battery life or solar panels. Communicates over I2C and possible to change the I2C address to have up to 4 of these Wings on one Feather.</p>

Adafruit FeatherWing OLED	Add a mini user interface to any Feather main board	14.95	oled_large.jpg	"<p><strong>*Now available to order, shipping November 2018. If you add additional items to your order, your entire order will not ship until November 2018.*</strong></p>
<p>This is the FeatherWing OLED: it adds a 128x32 monochrome OLED plus 3 user buttons to any Feather main board including the new Particle Argon, Boron, and Xenon.</p>
<p>These displays are about 1&quot; diagonal and very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. This screen is made of 128x32 individual white OLED pixels that provide a crisp display. Includes a reset button and three mini tactile buttons (A, B, and C) so you can add a mini user interface to your feather. Works with all Feather boards and stacks with FeatherWings, using only the two I2C pins.</p>

Adafruit Power Relay FeatherWing	"The Power Relay FeatherWing gives you power to control, and control over power"	9.95	PWRLY_large.jpg	"<p><strong>*Now available to order, shipping November 2018. If you add additional items to your order, your entire order will not ship until November 2018.*</strong></p>
<p>This is the Power Relay FeatherWing. It gives you power to control...well power. Turn on and off lamps, fans, solenoids, and other small appliances that run on up to 250VAC or DC power; can handle up to 1200 Watts. Works with all Feather boards including the new Particle Argon, Boron, and Xenon.</p>
<p>Each FeatherWing comes with a fully assembled and tested PCB header you can use to attach to your Feather. By soldering closed the jumper on the underside of the Wing, you can select which pin you want to use for the relay control. Some light soldering is required.</p>
<p>This Wing has a non-latching type relay. You can switch up to 10A of resistive-load current at 120VAC, 5A at 240VAC, and with inductive loads, about half that. Please note: If using with high voltages (&gt; 24V) use care and common sense. High voltages require experience, and are only for use by engineers who are comfortable with guidelines and know how to use them safely.</p>

Grove Starter Kit for Particle Mesh	Explore the world of sensing with Particle Mesh	35	Grove_Starter_Kit_large.jpg	"<p><strong>*Now available to order, shipping November 2018. If you add additional items to your order, your entire order will not ship until November 2018.*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note the Grove Starter Kit does not include a Particle development board. You will need to purchase a Particle Mesh Argon or Boron to accompany this kit.</strong></p>
<p>The Starter Kit is designed to make your first exploration into the world of sensing and actuating a breeze. The kit comes with seven different components that work out-of-the-box with Particle Mesh hardware and let you focus on learning the basics. Working with Starter Kit requires no soldering and minimal wiring. Simply connect the kit&#8217;s Grove Shield (the new co-developed FeatherWing adapter from Particle and Grove) to your Particle Mesh board and use the included cables to connect the adapter and the sensors and actuators that you want to use. It&#8217;s a plug-and-play experience.</p>

Power Shield	Easily add and monitor power with this shield that ships along with a 3.7V Li-Po battery	25	PowerShield_DSC3750_large.jpg	"<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>The Power Shield is the best way to&#8212;you guessed it&#8212;provide power to your mobile Particle projects. Based around the MCP73871 battery management controller, this shield allows you to simultaneously power a Photon and charge a connected Li-Ion or Li-Po battery. You'll also be able to monitor battery levels using the Photon itself, which makes the Power Shield the best way to untether your wireless project.</p>
<p>Besides the on-board USB port, you can also use an external DC power supply or solar-cell to charge the battery.</p>
<p>This shield ships with a 3.7V Li-Po battery and headers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed for use with the Photon, backwards compatible with the Core.</p>
<ul>

Wi-Fi Antennas	Add additional range to your Photon or Core uFL with a Flex or Duck Antenna	10	150802_Particle-15_large.jpg	"<p>These external antennas are the perfect way to extend the wireless range of your Particle-powered Wi-Fi project.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>The ultra portable <strong>Flex Antenna</strong> is particularly useful when space is at a premium, but you want a little more range than a chip or trace antenna can provide. It requires no additional connector &#8212; it attaches directly to the u.FL connector already on your Core u.FL or Photon.</p>
<p>Cable length - 100mm; Input Connector - IPEX(u.FL)</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>The <strong>Duck Antenna</strong> is especially great for projects that need a metallic enclosure, which often block Wi-Fi transmission. The antenna includes an interface cable for RP-SMA to u.FL. The Duck Antenna can be used with the Photon as well as&nbsp;Cores with u.FL connectors.</p>
